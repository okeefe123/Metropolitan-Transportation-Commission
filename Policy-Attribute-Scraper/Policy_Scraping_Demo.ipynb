    "1. Generate a pipeline to ease the burden of manually updating values for Zoning Atribute tables on Socrata from online documents.\n",

    "1. Retrieve previously scraped policy documents from company s3 bucket.\n",

    "2. Extract information by attribute using regular expression patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Organize found attributes into a single pandas DataFrame.\n",

       "1653   The general plan outlines goals, objectives and policies regarding the character of residential uses and development. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide regulations that implement these goals, objectives and policies, which provide a wide range of residential opportunities and dwelling unit types to meet the needs of present and future Cloverdale residents. It is the further intent of this chapter to ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and open space for each dwelling; to minimize traffic congestion and to avoid the overloading of utilities; to prevent the construction of buildings of excessive bulk or number in relation to the land area around them; to protect residential properties from objectionable noise, illumination, unsightliness, odors, smoke and other influences; and to facilitate the provision of utility services and other public facilities commensurate with anticipated population, dwelling unit densities and service requirements.

This district is intended to create, preserve, and enhance areas for very low density single-family housing in outlying, undeveloped hillside areas. Standards will ensure that development is compatible with hillside conditions and promote clustered development to preserve open space. Minimum lot size for this designation is 6,000 square feet, which may be reduced with clustered development.   \n",

Definition. The General Plan establishes minimum and maximum densities for residential uses in all parts of the city. Residential density is a computation expressing number of dwelling units per acre based on the gross lot area prior to the dedication of any rights-of-way, public parks or other public areas. In cases where a project site encompasses more than one lot, the density may be averaged over the entire project site.   \n",
